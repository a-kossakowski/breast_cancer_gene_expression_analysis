# Notebooks for Gene Expression Analysis

## Overwiev
This folder consists of notebooks I use for data preprocessing and analysis for the Breast Cancer Gene Expression Analysis project.

## Contents

### Important: if you can't open a notebook via GitHub, copy-paste it's link into [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).

**01_Data_Cleaning_and_Normalization.ipynb**: Data preprocessing, normalisation and cleaning.

**02_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb**: First analysis on the prepared data; allows a brief overwiev before the proper analysis.

**03_Pearson_Correlation.ipynb**: Correlation analysis for each normalised sample.
